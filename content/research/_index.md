Specifically, I am interested in the deformation and fracture of glacier ice. I use observational data to determine the relevant timescales affecting glacier and ice sheet change across spatial scales, from isolated crevasses to entire ice shelves, reconciling observations of ice fracture and iceberg calving with mechanical and statistical models. <br> <br> This research goal sits at the intersection of many fields, and broadly I am interested in:
<ul>
  <li>Fracture Mechanics</li>
  <li>Remote Sensing (SAR and InSAR Processing)</li>
  <li>Statistical Mechanics and Stochastic Models </li>
  <li>Time Series Decomposition</li>
</ul>

Below are published papers and links to presentations.
